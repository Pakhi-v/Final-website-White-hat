# Final-website-White-hat
The main aim of our project is to spread more and more awareness about Covid-19 to each and everyone and also our objective is to create a hub where people can get all covid related information and resources just at one place so that they do not need to visit aur find too many websites.

This repository contains the final html,css,js file that were made for hack-O-uplift hackathon.
